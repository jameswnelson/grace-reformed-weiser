- **Benediction**: We close with God's blessing

### What to Wear

Come as you are! We welcome people in everything from casual clothes to business attire. What matters most is that you're here to worship God.

### Children

We welcome children of all ages in our worship service. We also have a nursery available for infants and toddlers, and children's activities during the sermon for those who prefer them.

## Getting Involved

### Small Groups

We have several small groups that meet throughout the week for Bible study, fellowship, and prayer. These groups are a great way to get to know people and grow in your faith.

### Service Opportunities

There are many ways to serve at Grace Reformed Church, from helping with worship to serving in the community. We believe that everyone has gifts to share.
