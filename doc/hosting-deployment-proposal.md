- **Pages repo**: `grace-reformed-weiser.github.io` (static files only)
- GitHub Actions builds and pushes to the pages repo
- **More control, but more complex**

### **GitHub Actions for Content Updates**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/content-update.yml
name: Content Update
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/content/**'
      - 'src/lib/calendar.ts'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Daily at 6 AM for calendar updates

jobs:
  update-content:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Update calendar data
        run: |
          # Script to fetch latest calendar events
          node scripts/update-calendar.js
      - name: Build and deploy
        run: |
          npm run build
          # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

### **Scripts for Common Tasks**
```bash
# scripts/add-sermon.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./scripts/add-sermon.sh "Sermon Title" "2024-01-14" "Pastor Smith"

TITLE="$1"
DATE="$2"
SPEAKER="$3"
SLUG=$(echo "$TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/ /-/g')

# Create sermon file
cat > "src/content/sermons/${DATE}-${SLUG}.md" << EOF
---
title: "$TITLE"
date: "$DATE"
speaker: "$SPEAKER"
audioUrl: "/uploads/sermons/${DATE}-${SLUG}.mp3"
summary: "Sermon summary here"
tags: ["sermon"]
---

# $TITLE

Sermon content here...
EOF

# Commit and push
git add "src/content/sermons/${DATE}-${SLUG}.md"
git commit -m "Add sermon: $TITLE"
git push origin main
```

### **Automated Calendar Integration**
```javascript
// scripts/update-calendar.js
const fs = require('fs');
const { google } = require('googleapis');

// Fetch events from Google Calendar
async function updateCalendar() {
  // Your existing calendar logic
  const events = await fetchCalendarEvents();
  
  // Update calendar data file
  fs.writeFileSync(
    'src/lib/calendar-data.json', 
    JSON.stringify(events, null, 2)
  );
  
  console.log('Calendar updated successfully');
}

updateCalendar();
```

### **Content Management Workflow**
1. **Sermon Upload:** Run script → automatically creates markdown file → commits to GitHub → site rebuilds
